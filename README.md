## Make an account
**Register** by visiting the login page, where you’ll be asked if you have an account, and enter your details to make one. 

Select your role based on what you would like to be: a mentor or a mentee.

## Contact a mentor
Mentees can use the search and filter functions to look for a suitable mentor.

They can enter an introductory email that will be sent to the mentor. 

As a mentee-driven scheme, it is their responsibility to initiate and maintain contact with your mentor.

## Mentor Acceptance
Mentors can go to their dashboard and view the mentees who have expressed their interest in a mentorship. 

They can click on ‘view more’ to see a description of the mentee and accept the invitation.

## Mentorship
Once the mentee and mentor have started the mentorship, they will be able to see each others' emails to start 
correspondence.

## Change account credentials
Use the **Profile** menu on the top tool bar to change your credentials.

Simply enter the new credentials and the old ones for verification purposes and the details will be updated
when you click Change Details.

## Administration
The administrator role is a special role with elevated privileges, such as suspending users, changing account details and viewing and dealing with reports.

The initial administrator (the ‘founder’) can also promote other users.

## The report system
Users can submit reports to administrators in case something inappropriate happens during the mentoring process. The administrators are then able to view the reports.
